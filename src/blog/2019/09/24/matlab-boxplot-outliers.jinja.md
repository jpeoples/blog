MATLAB's `boxplot` function will explicitly show outliers by default.
These outliers are chosen differently than the default `isoutlier`
behaviour.

Suppose I have some data in an `N` by 10 array and pass it to matlab's
`boxplot`. By default, I get

![default boxplot](boxplot.png)

Suppose I want to extract statistics that MATLAB uses to generate the
plot. According to the [documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/boxplot.html)

> the central mark indicates the median, and the bottom and top edges of
> the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. The
> whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered
> outliers, and the outliers are plotted individually using the '+'
> symbol.

Using simple MATLAB built-ins I might then write

```matlab
function [q1,q2,q3,w0,w1,outliers] = boxplot_statistics(data)

    % quantile(data,3) will return the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile
    % for each column
    quants = quantile(data, 3);
    q1 = quants(1,:);
    q2 = quants(2,:);
    q3 = quants(3,:);

    % outliers will return a logical array where true indicates outliers
    % (outlier are computed per column)
    outliers = isoutlier(data);

    % To compute the whiskers, take max and min (per column). Setting
    % outlier values to NaN causes them to be ignored.
    data(outliers) = NaN;
    w0 = min(data,[],1);
    w1 = max(data,[],1);
end
```

Then here is the result.

I've plotted the predicted tops and bottoms of the boxes in blue, the
medians in red, the whiskers in green, and the outliers in cyan. Notice
how the predicted outliers (cyan) drop below the actual whisker in
several places (and as a result the predicted upper whisker (green) is
also too low).

What gives?

Digging deeper into the `boxplot` documentation, there is a parameter
'Whisker' with default value 1.5:

> Maximum whisker length, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Whisker' and a positive numeric value.
>
> `boxplot` draws points as outliers if they are greater than `q3 + w × (q3 – q1)` or less than `q1 – w × (q3 – q1)`

Hence, `boxplot` classifies outliers as those values that are `w`
quartile ranges above the upper quartile or below the lower quartile.

On the other hand, [`isoutlier` classifies points as outliers if they are
more than 3 scaled median absolute deviations from the median.](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/isoutlier.html)

It turns out that if `w = 1.5` we can achieve the same outlier
classification with `isoutlier(data, 'quartile')`.

However, if we choose a custom value for the `Whisker` parameter, we'd
like to be able to handle that too. Hence the final answer is:
