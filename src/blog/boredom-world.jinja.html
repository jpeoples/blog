This blogchain is an ongoing investigation of boredom, overload, meaning
collapse, and related themes.

My foray into this topic began with [two][webs] [posts][bus] from 2019,
where I began to think about information overload and "ephemerality"
more generally, as a source of anxiety or overwhelm. Since then, I've
began to see this in terms of boredom, understood as the inability to
make a decision (due to too much noise, or too much redundancy), which
is the topic of the first post.
