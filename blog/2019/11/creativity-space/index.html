<hr />



<p>One of my hobbies is writing,
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/jacob-peoples-5">recording</a>, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pake-jeoples">producing</a> music.
Unfortunately, I have
often been hit by something like creative block.  The two ways this
primarily manifests is on the one hand as a lot of barely started
projects<sup id="fnref:project-names"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:project-names">1</a></sup>, and on the other as more developed
ideas where I simply ran out of steam.  Most often cases in the former
category don&rsquo;t really amount to anything: when or if I do return to them
later there usually isn&rsquo;t really enough material to provide much more
inspiration than an empty project. Indeed, the amount of work required
to finish such a barely started project is nearly the same as just
starting from scratch.  This is in contrast to cases in the latter
category which are actually quite likely to get finished some day.  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pake-jeoples/reprobate-remainder">My
most recently uploaded
track</a>, as of
this writing, is the finished version of a project I started in
April 2018. The majority of elements were already there, in a rougher
form than in the final track, and all I really had to do was improve
some of the sounds, do some mixing, add some polish. The newly added
content was minimal.</p>
<p>The contrast between these two cases is kind of interesting. While the
false starts may have in some instances represented ideas that seemed
promising at the start, I think most of the time they are pretty much
just failed experiments. Especially when you are new to something, such
failed experiments are an inevitable part of the process. On the other
hand, the near finished projects were obviously promising enough to
warrant being taken so close to completion. While you still got stuck,
the time away works to your advantage: whatever road block you hit that
kept you from finishing the thing in the first place is long forgotten.
So instead, you get a great start of an idea to which you can apply your
refreshed—and in the interim, likely refined—creative process. The
process of finishing can in such cases be a pleasant experience of
applying your skills without the more taxing process of trying to shape
an entire work from scratch.</p>
<p>In between these many incomplete projects and failed experiments are the
works of inspired creativity—something which I imagine has tormented
anyone who does any kind of creative work. The work seems to flow out of
you naturally, joyfully. Indeed, one might be tempted to think of this
state as being synonymous with creativity. But alas, it is unreliable,
coming in erratic bursts. To be prolific, most of us can’t wait for this
kind of inspiration.</p>
<p>An interesting observation is that the process of completing the
unfinished track I talked about above was a little bit like those
experiences of inspired creativity. There was never really any creative
block. I just got to work on the next thing until the track started to
feel finished.</p>
<h2 id="destinations-and-exploration">Destinations and Exploration<a class="headerlink" href="#destinations-and-exploration" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>SeamlessR, a music producer who also makes youtube video tutorials,
touches on this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A--Ff6P8drk">Ammunition and
Experience</a>. There are at
least two ideas in that video. First is that experience provides a kind
of ammunition in the form of an intuition as to where things can go at
different stages of a project. The other is that given an idea,
experience also provides the knowledge needed to move in the right
direction to realize that idea. Though experience is given as the key in
both cases, the two are very different: the first is about knowing your
destination, and the second is about having the skills to actually get
to it.</p>
<div class="text-center"> <iframe max-width="100%" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A--Ff6P8drk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>

<p>It is worth pointing out that these are not really mutually exclusive.
Once you pick a destination, your experience gives you a sense of how to
get there. As you start to move in that direction the new context gives
you new ideas. Some of those ideas change your target destination. And
so on.  This cycle of choosing a direction, moving a bit, then
reevaluating that direction, starts to sound a lot like a search process
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent</a>.
A gradient descent optimizer looks for peaks or valleys (depending on if
it is minimizing or maximizing) in some function by cycling back and
forth between finding the direction of steepest descent/ascent at the
current location, and taking a small step in that direction.</p>
<p>Through this lens, the creative process is a kind of search for
&ldquo;pleasing&rdquo; points—for some subjective definition of pleasing—in an
extremely high dimensional space.</p>
<p>This is in some sense literally true. Sticking with the music production
example, if you look at a typical digital audio workstation, it is
essentially this big array of knobs and dials and sliders and curves and
midi/audio data that can be manipulated in all kinds of context-specific
ways, and that all affect what the end result will be when you
ultimately press the play button. Our job as the producer then, is to
find the right spot in the space of possible configurations of all these
controls to produce an end result that is pleasing.</p>
<p>Not only is the space huge and high dimensional; much of it is
degenerate or pathological. That is, many of those configurations of
knobs and sliders and curves and data will be mostly the same—I can
synthesize nearly identical sounds in multiple ways for example—and
many others will be akin to noise, or too unpleasant or chaotic to be
desirable. Making matters worse, even if we could learn to perfectly
avoid the degenerate and pathological parts of this space, what remains
is still too daunting and incomprehensibly large to be able to just
aimlessly explore and happen upon something pleasing<sup id="fnref:pleasing"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:pleasing">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The role of experience in this framework is then to provide two kinds of
knowledge and/or intuition which guide the search process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of potential destinations: experience develops awareness and
  intuition about pleasing regions of the space that can help define and
  refine target destinations. This is essentially the first kind of
  ammunition discussed by SeamlessR.</li>
<li>Navigational knowledge: experience teaches you to read local cues and
  navigate nonlocal jumps to target destinations in this complex space.
  This corresponds to the second type of ammunition from the video.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-the-experiences-of-creative-work">Understanding the Experiences of Creative Work<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-the-experiences-of-creative-work" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>We can employ this model to try and understand the three common
experiences of creative work mentioned above: false starts,
nearly-finish-complete-later, and inspired creativity.</p>
<p>The false start could manifest in a couple ways. First, without any real
vision of what we want to create early on, we might wander about a
little bit, fail to come up with an idea, and then give up. On the other
hand, maybe we do have some vague vision early on, but lack the required
skill to navigate toward that region of the space successfully. Instead,
we set out in our best guess of the right direction, but quickly get
lost.</p>
<figure class="text-center">
    <img alt="Illustration of a false start" title="Illustration of a false start"  src="https://jpeoples.github.io/blog/2019/11/false-start.jpg"  width="500"   />
</figure>

<p>The nearly-finish experience manifests as having a vision for what our
destination is (whether it came from inspiration or exploration) but
then getting lost after getting most of the way there. When we come back
to complete the work later, we are reminded of the vision, and, starting
much closer, are able to make our way there with relative ease. That
said, we may, if we don&rsquo;t yet have enough experience to realize our
vision, still not be able to get unstuck.</p>
<figure class="text-center">
    <img alt="Illustration of a false start" title="Illustration of a false start"  src="https://jpeoples.github.io/blog/2019/11/nfcl.jpg"  width="500"   />
</figure>

<p>Finally, inspired creativity looks a lot like the complete-later phase
of the previous case. The only difference is the journey from start to
vague vision is longer. But if the vision is within our grasp at our
current experience level, we are able to navigate into the general
region fairly easily.</p>
<figure class="text-center">
    <img alt="Illustration of a false start" title="Illustration of a false start"  src="https://jpeoples.github.io/blog/2019/11/inspired-creativity.jpg"  width="500"   />
</figure>

<p>In the cases where we successfully make it to the region of the space
evoking the creative vision (marked &ldquo;vague vision&rdquo; in the diagrams), the
search becomes easier. We are where we want to be, roughly, so it is a
matter of finding the nearest local optimum in the &ldquo;pleasing&rdquo; field and
calling the work done. In the diagrams this is represented by the path
going from zig-zaggy to relatively direct.</p>
<p>In contrast, when we get stuck, we are essentially trapped in some
not-very-pleasing region of the space, where we are unable to determine
how to move to improve the situation, or get closer to our vague vision
if we have one.  The result is a kind of overwhelm in the face of
ambiguity and high uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="dont-get-stuck">Don&rsquo;t Get Stuck<a class="headerlink" href="#dont-get-stuck" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps this is not such a revelation, but creativity is a fundamentally
a productive activity. And therefore, to do creative work, you must
work. Productively. And <a href="http://bookofhook.blogspot.com/2012/09/productivity-vs-uncertainty-apathy.html">nothing hinders productive work like
uncertainty</a>.</p>
<p>If the creative process is looking for pleasing points in a super high
dimensional space, uncertainty occurs when we are unable to distinguish
local directions in order to continue making progress. In the
optimization metaphor, we are trapped in a peak or valley—that is,  a
local minimum or maximum. Flailing about to try and get out of such a
peak or valley is hard for a typical optimizer, so it is better if you
can <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/15/mediocratopia-4/">avoid getting stuck in the first
place</a>.</p>
<p>From the model of inspired creativity above, it seems the best way to
avoid getting stuck would be to have a creative vision that is
realizable given our current level of skill. You can imagine the vision
as putting a large bias in the &ldquo;pleasing&rdquo; field against points outside a
particular region that we can then use to navigate toward that region.
The skill/experience component is still critical: if we don&rsquo;t have the
experiential skills to navigate to the target region, the bias doesn&rsquo;t
help, because we can&rsquo;t translate the cues it is giving us into actual
directions. But assuming we do, once we get there, we go into ordinary
optimization mode and find a local optimum.</p>
<p>So then how do we find a vision?</p>
<p>As discussed above, there is a feedback cycle between moving in the
space and refining the target destination.  It stands to reason then,
that one way to find a vision is just to explore, and see what happens.
And perhaps, if generating a vision purely through exploration is
reliable enough with sufficient experience, then that is why some highly
prolific artists say <a href="https://www.edmprod.com/episode-54/">creative block is
bullshit</a>. But in my experience
this aimless exploration can also lead to a lot of failed experiments.
So for the rest of us, with the framing we now have, perhaps we can
consider some other methods to try and bootstrap a vision when we lack
organic inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="artificial-constraints">Artificial Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#artificial-constraints" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Constraints can help break creative block. Most people are familiar with
this in the form of time constraints. When deadlines loom, it seems to
help us get started. This is Parkinson’s law: “work expands so as to
fill the time available for its completion.” But as Anne-Laure Le Cunff
writes in a <a href="https://nesslabs.com/parkinson-law">post on exploiting Parkinson’s
law</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchers found that when people face scarcity, they give themselves
the freedom to use resources in less conventional ways—because they
have to. The situation demands creativity which would otherwise remain
untapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this is why some game developers find constrained
platforms—like the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">Pico-8</a>
fantasy console—so freeing. There are all kinds of decisions that
constrain the design space of possible games for the platform that you
as a developer simply don’t need to make.</p>
<p>Within our mental model we might explain this phenomenon by observing
that, when developing a vision, artificial constraints make the
exploration process less overwhelming by reducing the dimensionality of
the search space. As we start to develop a vision, if our chosen
constraints play to our existing strengths, they could also help make
the navigation process less prone to failure.</p>
<h3 id="combinatorial-creativity">Combinatorial Creativity<a class="headerlink" href="#combinatorial-creativity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>“<a href="https://nesslabs.com/combinational-creativity">Combinatorial
creativity</a> is the
process of combining old ideas to come up with something new”. In our
mental model, I think this amounts to taking some points or specific
regions in the space, and asking: what might a subspace that contains
all these points look like? And within that subspace, what are some
other interesting and unique regions that I can explore?</p>
<p>On one hand, by letting us think about regions of a subspace, a
combinatorial approach helps us develop a vision in a relatively direct
way. On the other hand, once we get to the general area, the subspace
also acts as a constraint on the optimization process. Further, we can
tailor the vision to our skills by choosing appropriately technical
examples to start with. For this reason, I wonder if this might be a
particularly powerful approach when working in a new, unfamiliar space.</p>
<h3 id="start-with-abundance">Start With Abundance<a class="headerlink" href="#start-with-abundance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In <a href="https://www.perell.com/blog/how-to-cure-writers-block">How to Cure Writer’s
Block</a>, David
Perell recommends you “start writing once you have so much information
that you can’t not write.” Echoing SeamlessR above, he quotes Sebastian
Junger: “‘If you have writer’s block, you don’t have enough
ammunition.’” The fundamental idea behind the post is to take notes
about your ideas and reference materials as they come in, and write once
you’ve got enough material to make the process easy.</p>
<p>In my reading, the recommendation is that the creative work, that is,
the writing, should not start until the creator has a big enough reserve
of context to resolve the ambiguity of starting. This gives you lots of
directions and ideas to explore while developing the vision for your own
contribution.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fundamentally, there is probably no mental model or technique that will
just keep you from ever getting creative block again. If there was a
simple formula, it wouldn&rsquo;t really be creative, would it? And even if
there was, you&rsquo;d still have to deal with motivation, and finding the
time, and a million other things, surely.</p>
<p>But I have found that this model helps me reason about some of the
problems I&rsquo;ve had in my own creative projects, and provides a nice
framework in which to think about and compare a lot of the common advice
for boosting creative output.</p>
<p>I also like that experience plays such an important role in the model in
order to successfully navigate the space. It&rsquo;s a reminder that if you do
get stuck, the best thing to do is just keep trying. Practice. Do more
failed experiments. Try finishing something even if it doesn&rsquo;t seem that
great. Roll with it anyway and see where it goes. You might surprise
yourself. And remember that <a href="http://visakanv.com/1000/0152-letter-to-a-young-songwriter/">quantity beats
quality</a>
when doing is the best way to get better.</p>
